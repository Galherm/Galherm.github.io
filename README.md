# Wellcome to my website!
My name is Gal Hermelin, and I’m a Data Analyst.


I previously worked as a Data Analyst in the R&D team at Redefine Meat. ![Redefinemeat logo](https://github.com/Galherm/Galherm.github.io/blob/main/Black_New_Meat-removebg-preview%20(2).png)

Currently, I’m on maternity leave, spending time with my 6-month-old daughter, Bar — who is very cute! :)
