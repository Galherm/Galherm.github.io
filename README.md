# Wellcome to my website!
My name is Gal Hermelin, and I’m a Data Analyst.


I previously worked as a Data Analyst in the R&D team at Redefine Meat. ![Redefinemeat logo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fjcpisani.com%2Fbrand%2Fredefine-meat%2F&psig=AOvVaw2KK-5QNAV-AojvJoEEgQMc&ust=1744011427507000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCLiDzNLzwowDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)

Currently, I’m on maternity leave, spending time with my 6-month-old daughter, Bar — who is very cute! :)
